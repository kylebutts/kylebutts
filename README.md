### Open Source Projects

- [`did2s`](https://github.com/kylebutts/did2s) and [`did2s_stata`](https://github.com/kylebutts/did2s_stata) estimates difference-in-differences models using an imputation estimator.

- [`ssaggregate`](https://github.com/kylebutts/ssaggregate) converts “location-level” variables in a shift-share IV dataset to a dataset of exposure-weighted “industry-level” aggregates, as described in Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel (2022).

- [`jive`](https://github.com/kylebutts/jive) estimates jackknife instrumental-variables estimation and variants with lightning fast speed.

- [`vcovSUR`](https://github.com/kylebutts/vcovSUR) allows estimation of the variance-covariance matrix and perform hypotheses tests across multiple regression models.

- [`fwlplot`](https://github.com/kylebutts/fwlplot) creates scatter plots of `y` on `x` after residualizing by covariates using the `fixest` package

- My open-source article and slides [latex templates](https://github.com/kylebutts/templates)

### Economics Profession

- [Mixtape Sessions](https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/) is a set of free and open-source course materials for applied economics courses

- [RUSH Brownbag](https://rush-brownbag.netlify.app) is a graduate-student and post-doc brown bag for Regional / Urban / Spatial / Housing economics
